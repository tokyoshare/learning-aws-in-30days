## Exam Score System

**Score Range**: 100-1000

**Passing Score**: 720/1000

**Working way**: using a scaled scoring model to equate scores across multiple exam types that may have different difficulty levels.

**Result**: You’ll immediately see a pass or fail notification on the testing screen when you finish the exam. A `“Congratulations! You have successfully passed...”` message will be shown if you passed the exam.

**Result report**: 
- The complete score report will be sent to you by email after a few days.
- The score report contains a table of your performance at each section/domain, which indicates whether you met the competency level required for these domains or not.
- AWS is using a compensatory scoring model, which means that you do not need to pass each and every individual section, only the overall examination.
- Each section has a specific score weighting that translates to the number of questions; hence, some sections have more questions than others. 
- The Score Performance table highlights your strengths and weaknesses that you need to improve on.

**Re-take**:

 - un-limit on exam attempts (until you pass the exam).
